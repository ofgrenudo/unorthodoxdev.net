Welcome to my website. It is written in markdown mostly, using HUGO. I like to think of this as my digital garden, 90~ of the content on the website I guarantee will be work related content. But some of it might be personal, as I adapt and get better at writing and posting things of mine online.

I have ran some form of a website since 2022, and as of lately (2023) I have finally decided to take it seriously. While Im again, not a true tech blogger, and I doubt there will be any rants on here, your free to take a browse and enjoy my website as is.

If you have any questions or comments please let me know.

Thanks : )
