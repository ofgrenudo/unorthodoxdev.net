## Bicycle Commuting has Greatly Improved Downtown

I think every other post ive read here since they have installed the new bike lanes downtown have been relatively negative. Up until the city decided to put the bike lanes in, reaching downtown via means other than car was either impossible, or really risky/dangerous. Now with the addition of the bike lanes on Lovell, West Michigan, Stadium, Portage, North, and Westnedge, and more it makes access to the heart of the city from all sides of the city bike accessible. Before these additions, I would'nt have felt safe to bike from my home to downtown.

For those of you who live within a 2-4 mile range of your job, I would really recommend you trial a bike ride in on the weekend. You will considerably cut down on gas usage and save on parking. I for one make it in quicker when I bike than I do when I drive. I don't have to worry about parking, I don't have to worry about traffic for the most part, and I am free to take whatever route is convenient to me. After a long day of work, I can take a detour home, and stop at the park to read a book, or take a different route or trail home, and im not limited by the constrains of traffic and parking.

Again, if you live within 2-4 miles of your workplace, id highly recommend you ride your bike into work one of these days and see how you like it.
