Everybody knows about [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com). The browser extension that blocks ads right? Well most ads. Theres often ads from social medias sites like facebook and twitter that slip through really. 

Although I recently learned that uBlock has the capability to extend those block lists. The easiset way to add capabilities to your uBlock is to find these pre made lists of URLs and it should begin to block those ads for you. These are really the same lists that DNS filters like pi-hole use.

A good website that has some of these lists are [https://easylist.to](https://easylist.to)

Browse to the website, and find what ever list you want and then select the button **add it to your blocker.**

This will open a new tab, and then uBlock will prompt you to subscribe it it. Select 'Subscribe' and then you will be live with that list.
