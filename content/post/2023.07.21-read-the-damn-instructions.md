Read the damn instructions. Im working on a new project for the website, and Im trying to upload what I have to github (a simple readme nothing more).

I create an empty repository, init, add, and commit locally. Set the remote repository, and try to push to the remote... And it fails? What have I done? What did I do? I have done this probably thousands of times. Where did I mess up? Will I have to recreate the folder? Should I re init the local repo?

What do i do?

immediately I search the error `error, failed to push some refs to the remote github repository.`. I find some stack overflow repository, and I begin reading. I trust stack over flow, they got some smart guys on there. Alot smarter guys on there than me because theres always awnsers to my questions.

It doesnt work. It doesnt work, what did I do. I followed the advice of this internet stranger. They posted the awnser recently (2021) what have I done. This is a catosrophic faliure on my end. Ill never be able to recover from this.

I switch tabs back to my github repository after reading the advice one strange lonlely internet post, and I read the instructions given to me by github.

Oh...

Ive forgotten to set the primary branch. Maybe ive had too much coffee.
