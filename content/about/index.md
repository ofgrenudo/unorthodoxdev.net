Hello all!

My name is Joshua Winters-Brown! I am a IT Expert specializing in Mobile Device Management tools like MECM, InTune, and Jamf. I have been working in IT since 2019 so roughly 4 to 5 years now (2023). Currently, i've been studying to take the CCNA, and Net+. I have been doing fairly well on my studying and am hoping to get the Net+ sometime before the end of 2024.

## Work and Hobbies

 
I am also a self taught software developer and have made so far many different applications. Currently I would like to say that I am taking liking to rust, and have been studying the language for around one year or so (since 2022). Before rust, I did mostly everything in javascript with node.js but came to really dislike the async and promises the program provided. At this point in my journey I feel relatively confident with rust and have been so far been able to really apply my knowledge and build a few applications using it. Besides rust, some of the languages I know are as follows:

| Language | Expertise Level |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Rust | Intermediate |
| Javascript | Intermediate |
| Java | Intermediate |
| C/CPP | Beginner |

When i'm not developing, or working, I am mostly outside enjoying time with family or friends or my dog. For those who are interested, heres a photo of my dog, [Oso](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/Oso)

#### Favorite Books

A good book is a good book. Here I mostly read Manga, Horror Books, or Non fiction books or papers about whatever i'm interested in right now. Ill leave my top four books here for you all. These are mostly Manga, but there is at one book with words :). For Non fiction books, I typically am reading something about political theory, or about history. I am open to recommendation's, but I may not stick with it.
