1. Begin preheating your oven and prepping a tray to cook your chicken tenders on. Once the oven has come to tempature, please begin placing the chicken tenders into the oven.
2. While the oven is pre-heating, it would be a good time to begin cooking your bacon, you want the bacon to be crispy and crumble into a million pieces to speard around your noodles.
3. Begin boiling water and cook your pasta to your taste.
4. While your noodles are cooking, use one other pot to make your cheese sauce, melt your butter and cream together in a large pan.
5. Once your butter has melted, add in your cheese, one at a time stirring in to incorporate it all. Finally, add your garlic, and stir until incorporated and everything is melted. Here you will want to add salt and pepper to test.
6. When your noodles are done, drain them and add them to the pan with sauce and stir to combine. Now you will want to add your bacon and stir to incorporate it all together.
7. Finally, remove your chicken strips from the oven when they are done and serve. As a tip you can add the basil to the top of your pasta bowl, and any additional bacon that may have been left over.
