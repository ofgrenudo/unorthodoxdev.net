## Ingredients

- [ ] Tortillas or Tortilla Chips (can be stale)
- [ ] Salsa
- [ ] Egg
- [ ] Ham (optional)
- [ ] Chorizo (optional)

## Instructions

> Note if you are opting to use chorizo, please cook it first, then continue these instructions. Add the chorizo around the same time you would add the ham.

1. In a pan, set the heat to medium
2. place two tablespoons worth of oil into the pan, and place your tortilla chips, if you are using tortillas, cut them into squares or triangles, and fry them. This may require more oil.
3. Once your chips are toasted, add your eggs. Now is a good time to add your ham if you are going to use it. 
4. Once your eggs are cooked and everything is toasty, add your salsa and allow it to heat up to the same temp. This will make your chips a bit soggy but that is all the purpose of this meal. 
5. Cover with cheese if you have it, and serve.
