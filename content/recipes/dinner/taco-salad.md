## Ingredients

- 1 head of lettuce, shredded
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 lb hamburger browned
- 2 cups of cheddar cheese shredded
- 3 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 1 bag dorites crushed
- 1/2 to 1 bottle Western French Dressing (8 oz)

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, layer each ingredient starting with lettuce and ending with tomatoes. Toss with western dressing and crushed doritos just before serving.

2. If you are planning for left overs, allow guests to add the doritos and dressing on their own to prevent any soggy nonsense.
