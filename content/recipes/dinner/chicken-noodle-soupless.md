<mark>**Notice, that this recipe, requires roughly 7 hours to complete, most of which are waiting on the slowcooker.**</mark>

## Ingredients

- [ ] Defrosted Chicken Breasts or Thighs (thighs preferred or chicken breasts cut into strips).
- [ ] 2 cans of corn, 3 or fresh cobs.
- [ ] 1 can of cut carrots, 2 fresh carrots.
- [ ] 3 chile poblano peppers.
- [ ] 1/4 cup of cream cheese.
- [ ] Parmesan cheese.
- [ ] (Optional) Mozzarella.

## Directions

Note because this recipie takes so long, its ideal to start this at home on my lunch break, or place the chicken in the morning on low, though ive never tested leaving the crockpot on all day cooking like that, I imagine it should be fine :)

### Preparation

1. If using Chicken Breasts, cut them thinly or into chicken strips. Once chicken preparation is done, season both sides and put into your dry slowcooker.
2. Next you will want to throw in your corn. If the corn is on the cob still, remove all leafy greens, and cut the cob into 1/3 or 1/2. Put into crock pot.
3. Slice carrots into chips, and place into crock pot.
4. Dice your 3 chile poblanos, and place them into the slowcooker.
5. Add enough water to the slowcooker, to cover everything. Place the lid onto the slowcooker and turn to high. Set a timer for 5 to 6 hours from now.

### Plating

1. Once your timer has gone off, please ensure that your chicken has reached an internal temp of 165 degrees. If it is at that temperature or above, give everything a good mix, and then turn the slowcooker off.
2. At this step, you need to begin boiling your noodles, to do this in the slowcooker would add an additional 2 hours and would be very hard to time appropriately without causing soggy noodles, so we will instead be boiling our noodles in a separate pot.
3. Either add fresh water to your new pot, or reuse the delicious chicken/veggie stock you've been boiling for the past few hours and boil that in your new pot. **By the end of this step, your crock pot should be drained of any liquids.**
4. Once your noodles have boiled, strain your noodles, and then place them into the slowcooker. Turn the slowcooker to low, and add in your 1/4 cup of cream cheese, mix thoroughly until the cream cheese has been completely incorporated.

Finally, plate and serve with a heap of parmesan cheese.
