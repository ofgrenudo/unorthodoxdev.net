## Ingredients

- [ ] [Home Made Noodles](/recipes/dinner/home-made-noodles/).
- [ ] 1lb Ground Beef or Turkey.
- [ ] 2 cups of mozzarella, ricotta, or cottage cheese.
- [ ] Spaghetti, or Marinara Sauce.

## Directions

1. Begin Making your [Home Made Noodles](/recipes/dinner/home-made-noodles/). Once you have set them aside to rest, begin prepping your ground beef or turkey. Season heavily, with italian seasonings.
2. Once your ground beef has complexly cooked through, drain grease into disposable container and kill heat on the stove.
3. Begin boiling water in a large pot now.
4. Next stir in your choice of cheese, favorably cottage cheese or ricotta cheese.
5. Now hopefully, we have given the dough a minimum 30 minutes of rest, we will want to next cut the dough into small pieces to roll flat, and cut into squares.
6. Place the filling in the middle of your ravioli noodles, and cover or fold. For the edges, you can press a fork firmly onto the edges to seal. Try putting water around the edges to help seal ravioli tightly.
7. Boil Ravioli for roughly 10 to 11 minutes.
