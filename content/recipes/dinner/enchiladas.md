Enchiladas are traditionally served stuffed with cheese or potatoes, but in america are commonly found stuffed with chicken. Realistically you can use what ever you want, ive even had carne asada enchiladas...

2. Remove them from the pot and allow them to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Once the chilies are cooled, put them in the blender together with the garlic, and a 1/2 cup of water. Blend until smooth. Here you can add sazon, oregano, salt and pepper to taste.
4. Heat the oven to 350F.
5. In a sauce pan place 2 table spoons of vegetable oil and heat it on medium.
6. Drown the tortillas one by one in the salsa we have made and then fry them in the oil until they are toasted on both sides.
7. Remove the tortillas from the pan and place on the side, now you will stuff them with the topping of your choice, potatoes, cheese, chicken, carne asada, etc...
8. Roll them tightly and place them in the pan to be sent to the oven.
9. Once your pan is full of enchiladas, cover them in queso fresco, and place in the oven. Cook until the cheese is melted.
10. Remove the enchiladas, and top with thinly cut lettuce, carrots, potatoes, etc...
