## Instructions

1. Dice the onion and garlic. Throw them both into a large soup pot on medium, medium high. Drop a splash of oil. (you dont need alot of oil because shortly youll be adding greasy beef to the mix.)
2. Dice the Bell Peppers and Tomatoes and throw them into the pot as you get them cut up. 
3. Add the ground beef, and continue to cook until the beef is cooked. At this point if you have red wine, and you have some good stuff stuck to the bottom of the pot, throw in a some wine to deglaze the pan.
4. Add the seasonings and canned tomato sauce. Turn the mixture up to high, and allow for it to boil. Once it begins to boil, put it back down to a low simmer. Stiring Occasionally.
5. Once the sauce has simmered for roughly 30 minutes, add the noodles, and stir it to combine. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
