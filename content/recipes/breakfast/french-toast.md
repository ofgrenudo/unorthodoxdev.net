## Ingredients

These ingredients make six french toast's.

- [ ] 4 large eggs.
- [ ] 6 slices of bread.
- [ ] 12 tsp's of cane sugar.

## Instructions

Begin heating your medium pan, on the stove. Place roughly a teaspoon as needed into the pan to prevent sticking of the sugar as it melts down.

In a bowl, crack all 4 large eggs, and add about two tablespoons of heavy whipping cream to the mixture. Beat the eggs, until it is a smooth consistency and a consistent color.

coat your bread in the egg heavy whipping cream mixture on both sides, then sprinkle about a teaspoon of cane sugar onto each side. Then place onto the pan.

Cook the french toast for roughly 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Repeat steps until you are out of bread.

Plate and Serve.
