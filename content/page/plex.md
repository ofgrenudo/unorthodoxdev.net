Hello All!

I hope this message finds you well! I've recently set up my own Plex server, and I’d love for you to join me. With Plex, you’ll have relatively unrestricted access to an endless library of Movies, and TV shows.

Here’s how you can get started:

1. Request Access using the [following form](#plex-access-request), (or scroll down a little more and fill it out there).
2. Sign Up: If you don’t already have a Plex account, you can sign up for free at [Plex Website](https://www.plex.tv/).
3. Notify Me: Once you sign up, send me a ping on any of the platforms you may have me on. Personally text message is preferred.
4. Accept the Invitation: Once you’ve signed up, I’ll send you an invitation to join my server.
5. Start Watching: After accepting the invitation, you can start exploring the library and streaming content right away.

Finally once you've signed up and accepted your invitation you'll of course want to install the app on your mobile devices as well as on your tv's etc. Note that plex does not allow for you to watch the content on your phone, unless you've paid for the app yourself. I don't receive any money from you purchasing the Plex or Ombi app. You can find shortcuts [to the application installers here](#application-links).

## Requesting Content

If there’s specific content you’d like to see added to the library, you can request it through Ombi using this link: [Overseerr Request Manager](https://unorthodoxdev.net/overseerr). <font color="#d79921"><b><u>Please sign in with your plex account!</u></b></font> For TV shows, kindly request them season by season as you watch them as TV Shows can be space intensive. Please note that I am currently limited to 6tb or 6000gb of storage.

If you have any questions or need help setting things up, feel free to reach out to me. I’m more than happy to assist.
