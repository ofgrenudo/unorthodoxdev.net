Parking is free for the event in the Miller Auditorium Parking Garage. Personal items will be limited to no larger than 4.5” x 6.5.” Tickets are required for this event. Guest seating will begin at 1 p.m. and is limited to ten guests per graduate. We anticipate the celebration lasting at least 60 minutes.

I hope to see you there!
