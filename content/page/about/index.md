Hello all~~~~

My name is Joshua WB (he/him)! I am a IT Expert specializing in Mobile Device Management tools like MECM, InTune, and Jamf. I have been working in IT since 2019!

## Work and Hobbies

I am a self-taught software developer with a deep passion for programming and problem-solving. My journey began with Java 7 SE, where I created various applets and programs, eventually leading me to robotics programming as the lead programmer for FRC teams [7658](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/7658) and [6002](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/6002). I also competed in the [SquareOne Education Network Autonomous Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge](https://www.squareonenetwork.org/) for three years, where I had hands-on experience utilizing hobby electronics and microcontrollers programming autonomous cars in C/C++ for competitions. During the latter part of my time competing in SquareOne, I began to developed a web interface to manage hardware and issue commands to the microcontrollers, which is what initially sparked my interest in JavaScript and Node.js. However quickly this led me to discover Rust in 2019, a language I have since fallen in love with. I’ve migrated most of my SaaS codebase from Java and Node.js to Rust, finding it to be a more powerful and efficient tool for my needs.

In addition to programming, I’ve been working in IT since 2019, covering a wide range of roles from LAN Technician to Systems Analyst. Over the years, I’ve developed strong skills in Mobile Device Management (MDM) and thoroughly enjoy the daily interactions and challenges that come with this line of work. The variety of tasks keeps me engaged, whether it’s managing infrastructure or troubleshooting user issues.

Running my [own website](https://unorthodoxdev.net/) and staying active with personal programming projects allow me to continuously sharpen my skills and stay on top of industry trends. I find these activities not only rewarding but also essential for staying current in a fast-paced field like IT.

More recently, I’ve been diving into the cybersecurity space, exploring new areas and expanding my knowledge in that direction. Cybersecurity feels like a natural extension of my IT and programming skills, and it’s an exciting challenge that I’m eager to pursue further.

At the moment, my top priority is finishing my education and obtaining more certifications to enhance my skill set. With school taking center stage, I’m committed to growing both academically and professionally to open up new career opportunities in the future.

Some certificates I am aiming for are as follows:

## In my free time...

When i'm not working, studying, or developing, I am mostly likely outside enjoying time with family, friends or my dog. For those who are interested, heres a photo of my dog, [Oso](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/Oso). Hes the bestest boy, and would love to (probably) meet you one day!

### Media

In general, im a fanatic for horror. It started with watching cheesy B horror / thriller movies, and slowly progressed into other media. One of my first experience with horror outside of B horror, was by reading Manga, by Junji Ito and many other artists. It then progressed into Japanese horror, and Korean horror. That being said, its not all that I consume. I am often reading books on political theory, as well as doing research on whatever else it is that i find interesting at the time. Ill leave some recommendations down below, on books and cinema that I enjoy (be warned most of it is going to be horror im sorry.)
