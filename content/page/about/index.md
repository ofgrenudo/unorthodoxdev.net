Hello all!

My name is Joshua Winters-Brown! I am a IT Expert specializing in Mobile Device Management tools like MECM, InTune, and Jamf. I have been working in IT since 2019.

## Work and Hobbies
 
I am also a self taught software developer and have made so far many different applications. Currently I would like to say that I am taking liking to rust, and have been studying the language since 2022. The first programming language I learned was Java 7 SE, where i made a few Java applets and programs. Using Java, I did quite a bit of robotics programming for competitions. Next, I worked on some autonomous car programming in C/CPP for a competition.

Twoards the end of my time competing, I began to develop a web interface to manage some of the hardware, peaking my interest in Javascript and node. After the competition was over I decided to begin working on a SaaS using Node JS. After learning that I hate the way JavaScript handles async and promises, logically I jumped to Rust.

Since then, i have fallen in absolute love with rust and programming language as a whole. Since, then I have migrated a majority of my SaaS codebase to rust, 

| Language | Expertise Level |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Rust | Intermediate |
| Javascript | Intermediate |
| Java | Intermediate |
| C/CPP | Beginner |

When i'm not developing, or working, I am mostly outside enjoying time with family or friends or my dog. For those who are interested, heres a photo of my dog, [Oso](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/Oso)
