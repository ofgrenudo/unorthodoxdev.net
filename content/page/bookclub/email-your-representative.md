A quick overview on this bill is as follows:

Key Points on H.Con.Res.14

- Restricting Healthcare access: Cuts to Medicaid ($880 billion) and indirect Medicare pressures could affect millions. Currently 80 million Americans receive medicaid and 2.8 million Michiganders. The hypothetical here is as the fed cuts funding to Medicaid, the state will have to pick up the bill, or not, leaving recipients with reduced or no coverage.

- Increasing the Debt Ceiling: Adding $4.5 trillion to the debt. As a part who cry's about fiscal responsibility, i beg for them to explain how this is fiscally responsible.

- Program Uncertainty: Reconciliation and enforcement mechanisms could lead to further, unspecified cuts, amplifying impacts on vulnerable populations. The floor, for this budget cut, is $880 Million, implying that they can cut any number greater than, but no less than that. The republican party, has the possibility to cut deep here.

## My Letter to Bill:

H Con Res 14	

Dear Bill,

As someone who claims to serve in congress “as Southwest Michigan's voice in the U.S. House of Representatives is to serve all members of the community. “, yet you voted yea on H Con Res 14. I am ashamed to have you as my representative. This bill, will cut a minimum $880 billion dollars from Medicaid (as the number presented is a floor, not a ceiling), affecting nearly 80 million Americans across the nation. As of September 2024, there is approximately 2.6 Million recipients in Michigan alone. Meaning that you single handedly partook in an action, against the best interest of quite literally millions of Americans within your beloved state as well as hundreds of thousands of constitutes who are directly within your congressional district. Even more so now that the bill has passed, becomes the dilemma of this budget. It will ultimately force states to face a choice. 
    1) raise taxes, 
    2) cut back on other services, or scale back on Medicaid. 
    
Expanding on some of the immediate effects of this bill on Medicaid, the nation will begin to see a major shift in service reductions. States may even begin to limit the benefits of many of your constitutes like fewer covered prescriptions or no more dental care for Medicaid recipients. Ultimately leading doctors to stop taking Medicaid patients.

By cutting the funding of Medicaid, under the pretense of waste. In what ways is this bill cutting waste in Medicaid? As I read it, it is demanding Medicaid be cut a minimum of $880 billion dollars. But does not list, anywhere in the document what programs in Medicaid that are wasteful. My interpretation of this, is that the mere concept of some of your constitutes receiving vital and important medical services via Medicaid, as the waste. And the easiest way to cut waste in Medicaid, is to cut the number of recipients. 

So I beg on you to answer my questions,

-	Ease my mind and define to me what waste this bill is exactly cutting?

-	How does passing this bill, cutting Medicaid, an essential service, vital to 80 million 
Americans, benefit any of your constitutes?

-	In what ways do you expect or anticipate the state of Michigan to handle the lack of funds within the next coming 10 years?
