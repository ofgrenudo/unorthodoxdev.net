      <description>I recently migrated my website from ghost blog to hugo which is a static site generator compared to the all in one package you get with ghost blog. One of the reasons I decided to make this change was honestly, I had no need for all of the many features that ghost blog provided. Something like Hugo was simple, and effective. It also allowed me to write my documents in mark down, and store the entirety of it in a git repository.</description>

      <description>Repository: https://github.com/ofgrenudo/tattoo/tree/master&#xA;Tattoo is the first complete program that I have written in rust. It consists of two parts, a library and the binary. One of the challenges I experienced when writing this application was the lack of abbility to include files outside of module&amp;rsquo;s folder that I was writing in. While I understand now why you should not do so and the kinds of compiler problems you would encounter.</description>

      <description>Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.&#xA;CI, Continuous onus Integration allows for each member of a team to integrate their changes into the main branch, multiple times a day.&#xA;Continuous Integration allows us to tighten the feed back loop. We are less likely to go off on your own and develop for days or weeks just to find out the approach you have taken isn&amp;rsquo;t working, or isn&amp;rsquo;t approved by peers.</description>
