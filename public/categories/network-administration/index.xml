      <description>Ever wonder what port your connected to when plugged into a ethernet jack? Open up wireshark and apply a filter, searching for cdp or lldp traffic. That will kick back:
The switches MAC Address. The port description. The switch system name. Some information about the operating system running on the switch. Don&amp;rsquo;t see any information populating? Most likely your network admins have disabled your switches from transmitting CDP or LLDP traffic.</description>

      <description>This is a guide i&amp;rsquo;ve created with some notes I have created while working through the networking+ content. While I do plenty of networking troubleshooting experience, these instructions ensure that I STOP, and SLOWN DOWN and think about the changes. Something else I enjoy about these instructions is they force me to think more about change management. Something I need more practice with.
Gather as much information as possible. If possible, duplicate the problem.</description>
