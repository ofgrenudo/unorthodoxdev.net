[{"content":"comment.unorthodoxdev.net Currently, my blog is made using hugo. The theme that I am using has the capability to enable comments, although they would all be hosted on a third party. Unfortunately for me, im unwilling to signup for said third parties. One saturday morning as I was drinking my coffee and browsing the blogs that I follow, landed on a favorite of mine: https://blog.ari-web.xyz/.\nI really love ari\u0026rsquo;s blog. I think that Ari does what the web was supposed to do and really embodies the the nature of blogging. Something that I aspire to do. But am too introverted to even post things about my self online, personally I get too wrapped up in making sure everything is perfect, that when I do get the urge to post something I post it and avoid my computer for the rest of the day in fear of finding a misspelled word (which happens more often than not).\nOne of the features of Ari\u0026rsquo;s blog that I really like is the https://user.ari-web.xyz/ section. Its a comment board that anyone can post to anon or not. While i havent looked at what Ari\u0026rsquo;s comment section was written in, im planning on writing this comment section in rust. My goal for now is to seperate the project into two secions\nBinary: comment.unorthodoxdev.net\nLibrary: cmanager (Comments Manager)\nThe Binary will contain the code related to the web hooks and buisness logic.\nThe Library will contain the code that will store said comments into a JSON file or whatever database I decide to use (a JSON file).\nImplementation Of course, we always must start with the library. The first step to making this comment board is figuring out what kind of data structure we will use. For now I will avoid thinking about databases, and focus on just figuring out what our data is going to look like.\nI start by imaginging that we have a html web page, that users connect to. There we will have a form that allows users to input into the form, the following information\nUser Name Their Comment From there, they will click submit and then it will create a post or a put to some backend service that will gather the following information\nid ip username comment visible time ( i just thought of this and will need to add it in the future) From there it will do some kind of content filtering, checking that the string length is appropriate, checking that there arent any vulgar words, here we could have a filter list, Censored Words, and Banned Words. Banned Words will have the comment shown as hidden and be logged and stored, along with the banned word being censored. Censored words will just replace the word that is not allowed or approriate, and replace it with @@@@@. for example, \u0026ldquo;God i @@@@@@@ you joshua. I hope you die \u0026mdash; Anon\u0026rdquo;\nIm sure I wont be able to catch all the possible ban able words and or censored words, but it will be a fun experiment to work on with word processing.\nWhere I have left off, you can currently create a new comment using cmanager::new(ip, username, comment); the next step here is saving it. I initially wanted to do just a json file, but decided to go against that to get me comfortable with using SQL. So far, im hoping to use a sqlite database, since it can one file, uploaded with the repository, and! it doesnt make a lot of overhang on my project.\nSo far I have also done some content filtering in the data that cmanager::new recieves. Currently limits are set at 500 characters for all values with the exclusion of the comment in which, I have allowed a small hate filled paragraph to be typed out and submitted on the comment board (10,000 characters). Anything more than that is one of two things, not worth reading, or an spam/advertisement.\nThe reason I bring this feature up is because there are no try fail, loops in rust. If someone where to buffer overload my program, it would just simply quit to a unrecoverable fail state where I would have to then manually log in and start the program. But whos to say someone isnt constantly submitting comments to my comment board, breaking my system. To prevent that kind of behaviour you can strongly type into the program the abbility to encounter those errors, and tell the compiler what to do.\nFor example, within the cmanager::new() function, I have written an if statement that checks the length of those values. It then returns a Enum containing a struct, that contains two parts. Information about the reason the program errored out. And a sample of the data that caused the error. This allows for me to log, what caused that error, and continue moving on as if it was intended behaviour.\nSimply put, that error was intended behaviour.\n#[derive(Debug)] pub struct Comment { id: Uuid, ip: String, username: String, comment: String, visible: bool, } #[derive(Debug)] pub struct CommentError { error: String, comment: Comment, } enum CommentResult\u0026lt;Comment, CommentError\u0026gt; { Ok(Comment), Err(CommentError), } if ip.len() \u0026gt; 500 { let problem_comment = Comment { id: Uuid::new_v4(), ip: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;.to_string(), username: username, comment: comment, visible: false, }; let ip_too_long = CommentError { error: \u0026#34;Error, your ip address was over 500 characters, this attempt has been logged, and will be reviewed later. Pleas try again :)\u0026#34;.to_string(), comment: problem_comment, }; return Err(ip_too_long); } ","date":"2023-07-21T12:48:09-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/making-a-comment-board-part-1/","title":"Making a Comment Board Part 1"},{"content":"Ive migrated my website from the ghost blogging platform to hugo (go hugo, go hugo, go!). Its a little simpler and easier to manage. I also feel as though I have more controll. Currently, im using the hugo-stacked-theme as it looks the most appealing to me, and is not a massive website with insane overhead. It also comes with a indexing feature that allows me (and you ofcourse) to search my content for specific keywords.\nAnother great thing about it being simple is I dont have to constantly monitor that the ghost instance isnt taking too much resources as the web server just lives on a static nginx route. The only thing I will have to get used to is making sure that before I push to the remote repository, that I have ran hugo so that it can build each of my pages.\nCurrently I am manually logging into the web server and pulling the repostory whenever I feel like it. In the future, ideally id set a cron job for every 30 minutes or something like that.\nehhh either way this new cms seems to be working.

Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\nCI, Continuous onus Integration allows for each member of a team to integrate their changes into the main branch, multiple times a day.\nContinuous Integration allows us to tighten the feed back loop. We are less likely to go off on your own and develop for days or weeks just to find out the approach you have taken isn\u0026rsquo;t working, or isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by peers. Continuous Integration forces you to work with your teammates earlier than when you feel is comfortable allowing for course correcting actions to be taken before you have wasted your time. So how do we make Continuous Integration a reality?\nTests Code Coverage Linting Formatting Security Vulnerabilities Tests Tests in rust are a first-class concept. This being said rust allows you to easily leverage the rust ecosystem to run unit and integration tests using\ncargo test cargo test also takes care of building the project before running tests saving you a command or two.\nCode Coverage Code coverage is a easy way to see if we have overlooked any section of the code base that have been poorly tested. The easiest way to measure code coverage of a rust project is via cargo tarpaulin a cargo subcommand developed by xd009642. You can install tarpaulin with\ncargo install cargo-tarpaulin You can run cargo-tarpaulin with\ncargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests Linting Rust maintains clippy the official rust linter. Clippy is included in the set of components installed by rustup if you are using the default profile. You can run clippy with\ncargo clippy In this CI pipeline we would like to fail the linter check if clippy emits any warnings. To do so we can run the following command\ncargo clippy -- -D warnings Note, from time to time clippy might suggest something you do not belive to be correct or desirable. You can mute these warnings with the following\n#[allow(clippy::lint_name)] Formatting Let machines deal with formatting while reviewers focus on architecture, testing thoroughness, reliability, and observability. Automated formatting removes a distraction from the complex equation of the PR review process. You might dislike this or that formatting choice but the complete erasure of formatting bikeshedding is worth the minor discomfort.\nRust actually has a built in formatter called rustfmt. rustfmt should be included in the default rustup components but if you are missing it you can install it via\nrustup component add rustfmt To format your whole project you can run\ncargo fmt In the CI pipeline we will ad a formatting step.\ncargo fmt -- --check This will ultimately fail when a commit contains unformatted code, printing the difference to the console. You can tune a project with a configuration file rustfmt.toml.\nSecurity Vulnerabilities Caro makes it very easy to leverage existing crates in the ecosystem to solve at hand. On the flip side, each of those crates might hide an exploitable vulnerability that could compromise the security posture of your software. The Rust Secure Code group maintains an Advisory Database on reported vulnerabilities for crates published on crates.io. You can leverage this advisory database with a tool called cargo-audit. You can install it with\ncargo install cargo-audit To use it you can run\ncargo audit Github Actions Below are some github actions you can add to your CI routines. To use them you will want too create the github actions folder and drop each of these files inside.\nmkdir -p .github/workflows cd .github/workflows audit.yml\nname: Security audit on: schedule: - cron: \u0026#39;0 0 * * *\u0026#39; push: paths: - \u0026#39;**/Cargo.toml\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;**/Cargo.lock\u0026#39; jobs: security_audit: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: taiki-e/install-action@cargo-deny - name: Scan for vulnerabilities run: cargo deny check advisories general.yml\nname: Rust on: push: branches: - main pull_request: types: [ opened, synchronize, reopened ] branches: - main env: CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always SQLX_VERSION: 0.6.2 SQLX_FEATURES: \u0026#34;rustls\u0026#34; jobs: test: name: Test runs-on: ubuntu-latest services: steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2 - name: Run tests run: cargo test fmt: name: Rustfmt runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable with: components: rustfmt - name: Enforce formatting run: cargo fmt --check clippy: name: Clippy runs-on: ubuntu-latest services: postgres: image: postgres:14 env: POSTGRES_USER: postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password POSTGRES_DB: postgres ports: - 5432:5432 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable with: components: clippy - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2 - name: Linting run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings coverage: name: Code coverage runs-on: ubuntu-latest services: steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable - name: Generate code coverage run: cargo tarpaulin --verbose --workspace ","date":"2023-07-19T21:01:12-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/ci-pipelines-with-rust/","title":"Ci Pipelines With Rust"},{"content":"Everybody knows about uBlock Origin.

A digital garden to me is a place for for my ideas, projects, and thoughts to be planted in, and sprout and grow in the future. Besides a personal journal on my computer Ive decided to make it a publicly facing blog. Ive decided to so for a few reasons. A digital garden allows space for critiques from others. I don\u0026rsquo;t know everything, nor do I know the best way to do one thing. Posting things publicly allows for a criticism from netizens.\n\u0026ldquo;As I grow, my notes will grow.

But at times though that statement can seem counter intuitive. Often, people share their weight loss publicly on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. Many report that doing so is a great way to stay motivated.\nWhen you think about it, some of the reason, people post things online is because it provides a way for you to receive praise along the way.

It also helps you explain in better depth, what you are working on.\nWorking in public also forces you to document not only your thoughts, but also your steps taken to get there.

The below tools will help you troubleshoot where your are on the subnet, what might be missing, and or misconfigured.

There really five (5) modes to ip.\nTunnel (Tunnel over IP) Route (Routing table entry) Rule (rule in routing policy database) VRF (Manage virtual routing and forwarding devices) XFRM (Manage IPSec policies) To find the IP addresses assigned to your server, use\nip address show This will give you each interface, numbered from 1 to ♾️ including the status (UP or DOWN), IPv4 and IPv6 address, and subnet mask and broadcast address.\n![[ip-address-show.png]]\nTo force a static IP address on a interface, you can do the following\nip address add 10.66.10.9/16 dev eth0 Then you will want to reboot the network card.\nip link set eth0 down ip link set eth0 up Make sure for the above command you are physically connected to the server otherwise, you may lose connection if your actively using eth0.\nIf things are still looking good, we can move on too routes.\nip route This will show all of routes advertised by our DHCP server as available as well as their weighted value identified by the metric lable. You should have a few things listed here. If not I would investigate that.\nMy connection is getting dropped, or reset somewhere along the wire. MTR (Matts Trace-route) is a program that allows you to diagnose issues like these. To use MTR, you will want to do the following\nmtr google.com My favorite flag to use with this is -b it shows the dns name as well as the IP side by side allowing for a quick analysis of the network having issues.\nmtr -b google.com You can also send a predetermined amount of pings with the -c flag.

This allows you to output the information into a txt file for later usage.\nmtr -r -c 20 google.com \u0026gt; mtr-google.log Note that doing so will lock your terminal working on dumping that data so I would recommend a smaller count. If you really wanted to get something running and then do something else in the mean time, you could apply a ampersand (\u0026amp;) to the end of your command to have it run in the background.

I have migrated away from ghost blog and now manage my site on hugo!\nFor some reason when I was looking up how to change [[domain names]] for my ghost blog, I kept running into recommendations that stated I should just reinstall ghost. I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that especially since so much content exists on this server already. It also reminded me that I probably need to take regular backups of the server anyways. Or at least, double book blog posts somewhere just in case! (Truthfully most posts end up in my notebook to begin with, and end up polished on the website). Below are my steps to migrate my blogs DNS record.\nSet your new DNS record, a day in advanced to the IP address of your server. In my case I was migrating from https://blog.unorthodoxdev.net to https://unorthodoxdev.net. I created a ANAME record and allowed it to propagate overnight. In the morning, I did the below steps.\nghost config url {new_url} rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf ghost setup ssl ghost restart Finally you want to visit your website and check your cert and go from there!\nI would also like to throw in that you might want to remove your ANAME record for whatever your website was before and upgrade it to a CNAME record. CNAME records are really just a redirect to whatever ANAME record you provide it.\n","date":"2023-07-19T12:20:21-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/migrating-ghost-blog-domain-names/","title":"Migrating Ghost Blog Domain Names"}]
