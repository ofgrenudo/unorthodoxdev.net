[{"content":"Ive recently had an encounter with a printer that creates 100s of copies of its self within the computers printer settings. Ive spent quite a bit of time tinkering with this printer and its settings. I think I’ve come to a resolution. Overall, to recap what I did; Opening up the Regedit there were 100’s of keys associated with the Xerox printer. Typically, these registry keys are created when installing the printer and the windows printui.dll handles it. But the amount of registry keys meant that windows kept recreating these keys. I dug a little bit more into the registry keys and it appears that each of these keys had the following properties assigned to them. Name “PRT-AWH-321-COLOR”, Driver “Xerox …” that was pretty much it. The rest of the fields were empty.\nI started off looking into removing these printers via a script etc. Doing so I found the existence of a registry key we can create that would have windows remove the printers on exit. To enable this feature you would have to create a 32bit dWord key in the following location \u0026quot;HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Providers\\Client Side Rendering Print Provider\u0026quot; with the name \u0026quot;RemovePrintersAtLogoff\u0026quot; and the value of 1.\nAfter creating this key, when a user logs out it should clear out any installed printers, and apply the group policy user settings next time a user logs in. Well creating that key and then logging out seemed to work. But those xerox registry keys persisted for some reason. I grabbed one of the GUIDS from a ghost printer and ran a search for all the instances I could find it in regedit. I ran across quite a few instances and ended up writing a script.\nWe start by stopping the printer spooler, and then removing the following:\nHKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Connections HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Printers HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Providers HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\V4 Connections HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Connections HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Printers HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Providers HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\V4 Connections HKCU:\\Printers HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\PrinterPorts HKEY_USERS\\.DEFAULT\\Printers The following below you need a system user context to remove. You can do so by using PSExec from Windows PowerToys.\nHKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\SWD\\PRINTENUM HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\DeviceClasses\\{0ecef634-6ef0-472a-8085-5ad023ecbccd} HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Enum\\SWD\\PRINTENUM HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\DeviceClasses\\{0ecef634-6ef0-472a-8085-5ad023ecbccd} HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet002\\Enum\\SWD\\PRINTENUM HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet002\\Control\\DeviceClasses\\{0ecef634-6ef0-472a-8085-5ad023ecbccd} HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{1ed2bbf9-11f0-4084-b21f-ad83a8e6dcdc} After doing so, when you open up the control panel all the printers should be grayed out. Because these printers are being added via group policy, doing a reboot, should resolve any issues we had previously. Once the computer comes back up again, all of those printers should remain grey, and anything that gets installed via group policy should then fill in with color. But shortly after, it started happening again. I kept getting notifications of the printer installing, over and over and over again.\nWith that, its confirms that it is not some residual left over install, but narrows it down to one or two things. A messed up group policy or a bad driver. Looking at the group policy I could find anything wrong, so I decided to start at the driver. I took the computer off the domain, and downloaded the PCL, General, and PS, driver for the printer.\nOnce the computers off the domain, I remove all printers. And repeat the above steps. After doing so I started with the identical driver installed, the General driver. I setup the printer and as soon as the install finishes. I immediately get the same issue again.\nIts no longer a group policy issue, its now a driver issue. Uninstall all the printers again and start from step one. Once I get to installing the printer I use the PCL driver. I had similar issues. Finally the Post Script (PS) driver ended up working for me and resolved in no issues.\nEither way, cleaning up the ghost printers is a pain in my ass, and is nothing but manual labor. I ended up reimaging the comptuers after fixing the driver on the print server and going from there.\nSince then its seemed to have been fixed.\nScripts part-one.ps1\nNew-ItemProperty -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Providers\\Client Side Rendering Print Provider\u0026#34; -Name \u0026#34;RemovePrintersAtLogoff\u0026#34; -Value 1 -Force Restart-Computer -Force part-two.ps1\nStop-Service spooler -Force Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Connections\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Printers\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Providers\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\V4 Connections\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Connections\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Printers\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\Providers\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Print\\V4 Connections\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKCU:\\Printers\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\PrinterPorts\u0026#34; -Recurse Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;Registry::HKEY_USERS\\.DEFAULT\\Printers\u0026#34; -Recurse .\\PsExec.exe /accepteula .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\SWD\\PRINTENUM\u0026#34; -Recurse .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\DeviceClasses\\{0ecef634-6ef0-472a-8085-5ad023ecbccd}\u0026#34; -Recurse .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Enum\\SWD\\PRINTENUM\u0026#34; -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\DeviceClasses\\{0ecef634-6ef0-472a-8085-5ad023ecbccd}\u0026#34; -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet002\\Enum\\SWD\\PRINTENUM\u0026#34; -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet002\\Control\\DeviceClasses\\{0ecef634-6ef0-472a-8085-5ad023ecbccd}\u0026#34; -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue .\\PsExec.exe powershell Remove-Item -Path \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{1ed2bbf9-11f0-4084-b21f-ad83a8e6dcdc}\u0026#34; -Recurse Restart-Computer -Force ","date":"2023-07-20T16:03:40-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/ghost-printers/","title":"Ghost Printers"},{"content":"Currently im looking into creating an application to harvest device information using the MECM API.

It consists of two parts, a library and the binary. One of the challenges I experienced when writing this application was the lack of abbility to include files outside of module\u0026rsquo;s folder that I was writing in. While I understand now why you should not do so and the kinds of compiler problems you would encounter. I think that forcing me to write a library to manage my goals was very benificial for me.\nThis is the first library that I have had to write that actually does something. Something more than one plus one, or something simple you make when you learn C. This library was immediately applicable to my needs. It also helped me keep my programs logically seperate from eachother. The UI was allowed to get input from the UI and handle that. The backend was able to take the information from the UI and transcribe it into the database. This way of seperating the program made a dream like fusion for me when it came to keeping things clean.\nWriting the library also forced me to leverage the rust documentation feature. Really cementing the whole experience together.\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience making this application and hope to have many more safe adventures with rust :)\nDescription Tattoo is a program designed to automatically collect device information on run, and insert it into the registry of the device. This information is intended for archival purposes and will remain there for later inspection. Some of the bennifits of storing information in the registry is that it provides a static and proctected way to maintain information like,\nThe day the computer was deployed.

Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\nCI, Continuous onus Integration allows for each member of a team to integrate their changes into the main branch, multiple times a day.\nContinuous Integration allows us to tighten the feed back loop. We are less likely to go off on your own and develop for days or weeks just to find out the approach you have taken isn\u0026rsquo;t working, or isn\u0026rsquo;t approved by peers. Continuous Integration forces you to work with your teammates earlier than when you feel is comfortable allowing for course correcting actions to be taken before you have wasted your time. So how do we make Continuous Integration a reality?\nTests Code Coverage Linting Formatting Security Vulnerabilities Tests Tests in rust are a first-class concept. This being said rust allows you to easily leverage the rust ecosystem to run unit and integration tests using\ncargo test cargo test also takes care of building the project before running tests saving you a command or two.\nCode Coverage Code coverage is a easy way to see if we have overlooked any section of the code base that have been poorly tested. The easiest way to measure code coverage of a rust project is via cargo tarpaulin a cargo subcommand developed by xd009642. You can install tarpaulin with\ncargo install cargo-tarpaulin You can run cargo-tarpaulin with\ncargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests Linting Rust maintains clippy the official rust linter. Clippy is included in the set of components installed by rustup if you are using the default profile. You can run clippy with\ncargo clippy In this CI pipeline we would like to fail the linter check if clippy emits any warnings. To do so we can run the following command\ncargo clippy -- -D warnings Note, from time to time clippy might suggest something you do not belive to be correct or desirable. You can mute these warnings with the following\n#[allow(clippy::lint_name)] Formatting Let machines deal with formatting while reviewers focus on architecture, testing thoroughness, reliability, and observability. Automated formatting removes a distraction from the complex equation of the PR review process. You might dislike this or that formatting choice but the complete erasure of formatting bikeshedding is worth the minor discomfort.\nRust actually has a built in formatter called rustfmt. rustfmt should be included in the default rustup components but if you are missing it you can install it via\nrustup component add rustfmt To format your whole project you can run\ncargo fmt In the CI pipeline we will ad a formatting step.\ncargo fmt -- --check This will ultimately fail when a commit contains unformatted code, printing the difference to the console. You can tune a project with a configuration file rustfmt.toml.\nSecurity Vulnerabilities Caro makes it very easy to leverage existing crates in the ecosystem to solve at hand. On the flip side, each of those crates might hide an exploitable vulnerability that could compromise the security posture of your software. The Rust Secure Code group maintains an Advisory Database on reported vulnerabilities for crates published on crates.io. You can leverage this advisory database with a tool called cargo-audit. You can install it with\ncargo install cargo-audit To use it you can run\ncargo audit Github Actions Below are some github actions you can add to your CI routines. To use them you will want too create the github actions folder and drop each of these files inside.\nmkdir -p .github/workflows cd .github/workflows audit.yml\nname: Security audit on: schedule: - cron: \u0026#39;0 0 * * *\u0026#39; push: paths: - \u0026#39;**/Cargo.toml\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;**/Cargo.lock\u0026#39; jobs: security_audit: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: taiki-e/install-action@cargo-deny - name: Scan for vulnerabilities run: cargo deny check advisories general.yml\nname: Rust on: push: branches: - main pull_request: types: [ opened, synchronize, reopened ] branches: - main env: CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always SQLX_VERSION: 0.6.2 SQLX_FEATURES: \u0026#34;rustls\u0026#34; jobs: test: name: Test runs-on: ubuntu-latest services: steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2 - name: Run tests run: cargo test fmt: name: Rustfmt runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable with: components: rustfmt - name: Enforce formatting run: cargo fmt --check clippy: name: Clippy runs-on: ubuntu-latest services: postgres: image: postgres:14 env: POSTGRES_USER: postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password POSTGRES_DB: postgres ports: - 5432:5432 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable with: components: clippy - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2 - name: Linting run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings coverage: name: Code coverage runs-on: ubuntu-latest services: steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable - name: Generate code coverage run: cargo tarpaulin --verbose --workspace ","date":"2023-07-19T21:01:12-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/ci-pipelines-with-rust/","title":"Ci Pipelines With Rust"},{"content":"Everybody knows about uBlock Origin.

A digital garden to me is a place for for my ideas, projects, and thoughts to be planted in, and sprout and grow in the future. Besides a personal journal on my computer Ive decided to make it a publicly facing blog. Ive decided to so for a few reasons. A digital garden allows space for critiques from others. I don\u0026rsquo;t know everything, nor do I know the best way to do one thing. Posting things publicly allows for a criticism from netizens.\n\u0026ldquo;As I grow, my notes will grow.

The below tools will help you troubleshoot where your are on the subnet, what might be missing, and or misconfigured. To get a quick overview of all of your connected network cards, you can run the following command\nnetworkctl status It will print out the following information:\nState: Routable or Not Online Status Address (IPv4 and IPv6) Gateway Address including the associated port. DNS Servers Domains NTP Servers. Network Card Configurations. If everything above looks good we can move on to looking more closely at our network cards.\nWhats my ip? The ip command allows you to show address information, manipulate routing, and display network devices, interfaces, and tunnels. It is a simple concept and hard tool to learn. There really five (5) modes to ip.\nTunnel (Tunnel over IP) Route (Routing table entry) Rule (rule in routing policy database) VRF (Manage virtual routing and forwarding devices) XFRM (Manage IPSec policies) To find the IP addresses assigned to your server, use\nip address show This will give you each interface, numbered from 1 to ♾️ including the status (UP or DOWN), IPv4 and IPv6 address, and subnet mask and broadcast address.\n![[ip-address-show.png]]\nTo force a static IP address on a interface, you can do the following\nip address add 10.66.10.9/16 dev eth0 Then you will want to reboot the network card.\nip link set eth0 down ip link set eth0 up Make sure for the above command you are physically connected to the server otherwise, you may lose connection if your actively using eth0.\nIf things are still looking good, we can move on too routes.\nip route This will show all of routes advertised by our DHCP server as available as well as their weighted value identified by the metric lable. You should have a few things listed here. If not I would investigate that.\nMy connection is getting dropped, or reset somewhere along the wire. MTR (Matts Trace-route) is a program that allows you to diagnose issues like these. To use MTR, you will want to do the following\nmtr google.com My favorite flag to use with this is -b it shows the dns name as well as the IP side by side allowing for a quick analysis of the network having issues.\nmtr -b google.com You can also send a predetermined amount of pings with the -c flag. Otherwise known as count it allows you to select how many packets to send.\nmtr -c 100 -b google.com The final command you will need to know about with mtr is -r or record. This allows you to output the information into a txt file for later usage.\nmtr -r -c 20 google.com \u0026gt; mtr-google.log Note that doing so will lock your terminal working on dumping that data so I would recommend a smaller count. If you really wanted to get something running and then do something else in the mean time, you could apply a ampersand (\u0026amp;) to the end of your command to have it run in the background. It will spit out a PID that you can search for later to see if its complete with\nps -e | grep 15225 Monitoring network traffic So, everything looks good, but data is still coming back corrupted? Lets look at the raw packets.\nThe below command allows us to capture all traffic that comes or goes from this interface within the following ip and subnet range.\ntcpdump -i eth0 net 10.66.0.0/16 We can also filter based on source (src) or destination (dst).\ntcpdump -i eth src net 10.1.0.0/24 or\ntcpdump -i eth dst net 10.1.0.0/24 Finally we can also capture traffic only coming or going from a specific port.\ntcpdump -i eth0 port 53 Combining the port traffic with a specific host\ntcpdump -i eth0 host 10.66.10.123 and port 53 ","date":"2023-07-19T20:58:00-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/linux-administration-tips-and-tricks/","title":"Linux Administration Tips and Tricks"},{"content":"Windows 11 and Start Menus suck. Nothing works the way Microsoft says it should unless you use Intune. So to get around it, we just copy the bin. For now I\u0026rsquo;m doing both, considering sometime in the future Microsoft might get its stuff together and allow the JSON file to work.\nCreating a new Layout On a build PC configure your new layout. run the Export-StartLayout command. Modify the StartLayout file and change the pinnedList to primaryOEMPins Copy the JSON file to C:\\Users\\Default\\AppData\\Local\\Microsof\\Windows\\Shell Alternatively, windows holds an encrypted version of the startup file in the %LocalAppData%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\LocalState folder. Copying the start.bin file to whatever computers same folder, will essentially do the same thing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also created a mini program that you can use to quickly do the above commands to quickly reproduce the steps above.

I have migrated away from ghost blog and now manage my site on hugo!\nFor some reason when I was looking up how to change [[domain names]] for my ghost blog, I kept running into recommendations that stated I should just reinstall ghost. I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that especially since so much content exists on this server already. It also reminded me that I probably need to take regular backups of the server anyways. Or at least, double book blog posts somewhere just in case! (Truthfully most posts end up in my notebook to begin with, and end up polished on the website). Below are my steps to migrate my blogs DNS record.\nSet your new DNS record, a day in advanced to the IP address of your server. In my case I was migrating from https://blog.unorthodoxdev.net to https://unorthodoxdev.net. I created a ANAME record and allowed it to propagate overnight. In the morning, I did the below steps.\nghost config url {new_url} rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf ghost setup ssl ghost restart Finally you want to visit your website and check your cert and go from there!\nI would also like to throw in that you might want to remove your ANAME record for whatever your website was before and upgrade it to a CNAME record. CNAME records are really just a redirect to whatever ANAME record you provide it.\n","date":"2023-07-19T12:20:21-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/migrating-ghost-blog-domain-names/","title":"Migrating Ghost Blog Domain Names"}]
