[{"content":"Windows 11 and Start Menus suck. Nothing works the way Microsoft says it should unless you use Intune. So to get around it, we just copy the bin. For now I\u0026rsquo;m doing both, considering sometime in the future Microsoft might get its stuff together and allow the JSON file to work.\nCreating a new Layout On a build PC configure your new layout. run the Export-StartLayout command. Modify the StartLayout file and change the pinnedList to primaryOEMPins Copy the JSON file to C:\\Users\\Default\\AppData\\Local\\Microsof\\Windows\\Shell Alternatively, windows holds an encrypted version of the startup file in the %LocalAppData%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\LocalState folder. Copying the start.bin file to whatever computers same folder, will essentially do the same thing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also created a mini program that you can use to quickly do the above commands to quickly reproduce the steps above.

I have migrated away from ghost blog and now manage my site on hugo!\nFor some reason when I was looking up how to change [[domain names]] for my ghost blog, I kept running into recommendations that stated I should just reinstall ghost. I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that especially since so much content exists on this server already. It also reminded me that I probably need to take regular backups of the server anyways. Or at least, double book blog posts somewhere just in case! (Truthfully most posts end up in my notebook to begin with, and end up polished on the website). Below are my steps to migrate my blogs DNS record.\nSet your new DNS record, a day in advanced to the IP address of your server. In my case I was migrating from https://blog.unorthodoxdev.net to https://unorthodoxdev.net. I created a ANAME record and allowed it to propagate overnight. In the morning, I did the below steps.\nghost config url {new_url} rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf ghost setup ssl ghost restart Finally you want to visit your website and check your cert and go from there!\nI would also like to throw in that you might want to remove your ANAME record for whatever your website was before and upgrade it to a CNAME record. CNAME records are really just a redirect to whatever ANAME record you provide it.\n","date":"2023-07-19T12:20:21-04:00","permalink":"https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/migrating-ghost-blog-domain-names/","title":"Migrating Ghost Blog Domain Names"}]
