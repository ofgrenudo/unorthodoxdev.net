        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am the ultimate procrastinator. I can never seem to commit, or consider a project done. I have a perpetual train of thought going on when I think of projects or problems. I often wont even start a project, unless I can envision the end. Some people may see this as a good trait, being that I am able to plan the project, and goals out from start to finish instead of aimlessly working on something. Sometimes, I may already have the end goal of my project or problem determined, but my issue is then, finding a way to complete it. Maybe not all the tools are there for me that I hope there would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been learning C. Not C++, not C#&amp;hellip; C. One thing I learned very quickly with C is that there is no hand holding. If you do not manage your memory, you&amp;rsquo;ve blown your program up. You don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do something, you&amp;rsquo;ve made your project 100 times harder now trying to include some foreign library, versus developing the solution your self. My initial Idea was to create a program, that pulls the API information from the local Transit station, and parses out the information into a pleasant way. This program in rust, hypothetically would be pretty quick, and i&amp;rsquo;ve already got an idea on how I would do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would start by using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;github.com/actix/actix&#34; &gt;actix&lt;/a&gt; to pull the API get request. parse the JSON response using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;serde.rs&#34; &gt;serde&lt;/a&gt;. Then use  &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;rata-tui&lt;/a&gt; to generate a beautiful text UI for it. All together, given I didn&amp;rsquo;t run into any hiccups, this project would probably be done in maybe~ 2 to 3 days If I used rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost a month of running through C projects and experiments. Ive found that, I am absolutely destroyed by the lack of features with C. My first challenge was making a get request to the Transit web api. I eventually resolved that issue using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curl.se/libcurl/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;libcurl&lt;/a&gt; which is very terribly documented, and everything is just a pain in the ass to read an understand. But one other issue with using libcurl, is that it requires that the system the program is running on, &lt;strong&gt;contains&lt;/strong&gt; the application curl. That is an issue that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really ran into before when programming with rust. Everything is just code, that compiles to assembler that compiles to binary, that the machine understands and executes. Now i have to add another contingent, an application I cant/don&amp;rsquo;t want to package with my application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand why applications ship with  DLLs. Or why the applications have underlying conditions when installing them. Regardless of how I felt about including libcurl, I moved forth and began to deal with my newly found string that contains the response from my API. After many &lt;code&gt;segfault&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve got to parse this JSON string. Like I stated above, I would simply just use the serde library. But because C doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a JSON library (C was made way before the web, or JSON existed) I need to create my own parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two issues, is reason enough for me to understand why some hardcore C developers keep every piece of code they have. Because when they run into the same JSON parsing issue, they can look at the function, or file that they made last time, and implement the same function or file into the new program.Rust and most modern languages have provided such a standard, containing large standard libraries and easy to import and manage 3rd party libraries that It was hard for me to think of a time where that wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option.&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;based&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I like the most about C is that it forces me to think. To use my &lt;em&gt;smooth&lt;/em&gt; brain on how to parse a JSON element, what are the rules that JSON employs? How can I connect to a HTTP Web server, on port 80? How can I save the response? All of these thoughts come from a &lt;em&gt;rough&lt;/em&gt; brain. One with ridges and valleys and peaks. Not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, I think the Transit app i was planning on building with C was a bit too big for me to handle right now, my plan now is to finish it in Rust, and then In preparation for the 2023 Advent of Code, i would like to begin practicing my C solving those problems. Problems which are small and manageable, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure have plenty of resources online for the language that I will be using. Shoot, I&amp;rsquo;ve even found &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/noulith&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a guy who created an entire language, for solving the Advent of Code problems&lt;/a&gt; conveniently in&amp;hellip;. Rust. So while i&amp;rsquo;ve completely changed the way I will handle my next app. I have added a completely other thing that I have dedicated my self to. Finding more things to do, when there is already so much.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/about/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Joshua Winters-Brown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-and-hobbies&#34;&gt;Work and Hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a IT Expert specializing in Mobile Device Management tools like MECM, InTune, and Jamf. I have been working in IT since 2019 so roughly 4 to 5 years now (2023). Currently, i&amp;rsquo;ve been studying to take the CCNA, and Net+. I have been doing fairly well on my studying and am hoping to get the Net+ sometime before the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also a self taught software developer and have made so far many different applications. Currently I would like to say that I am taking liking to rust, and have been studying the language for around one year or so (since 2022). Before rust, I did mostly everything in javascript with node.js but came to really dislike the async and promises the program provided. At this point in my journey I feel relatively confident with rust and have been so far been able to really apply my knowledge and build a few applications using it. Besides rust, some of the languages I know are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Expertise Level&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rust&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Intermediate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Javascript&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Intermediate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Intermediate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C/CPP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Beginner&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When i&amp;rsquo;m not developing, or working, I am mostly outside enjoying time with family or friends or my dog. For those who are interested, heres a photo of my dog, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/Oso&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally read, Im a big fan of horror. Not just horror books. But horror everything. I typically really enjoy foreign horror. So far some of my favorite books have been,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;favorite-books&#34;&gt;Favorite Books&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good book is a good book. Here I mostly read Manga, Horror Books, or Non fiction books or papers about whatever i&amp;rsquo;m interested in right now. Ill leave my top four books here for you all. These are mostly Manga, but there is at one book with words :). For Non fiction books, I typically am reading something about political theory, or about history. I am open to recommendation&amp;rsquo;s, but I may not stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In dire need of comments.</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/comment-board/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:07:32 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/comment-board/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently migrated my website from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ghost blog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt; which is a static site generator compared to the all in one package you get with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ghost blog&lt;/a&gt;. One of the reasons I decided to make this change was honestly, I had no need for all of the many features that ghost blog provided. Something like Hugo was simple, and effective. It also allowed me to write my documents in mark down, and store the entirety of it in a git repository. Making the portability of my website insanely simple, compared to managing the ghost blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features I missed from ghost blog though, was the comment feature. Something I really enjoyed. With some Hugo blogs, they do enable you to add a comment feature, but requires that you have some kind of third party application that you sign up for. That pretty much was a no go for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have my self or readers sign up for some ooey gooey third party provider. So because i&amp;rsquo;m lazy, I decided to create my own comment board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive been learning rust for some time now so I settled on that language. It would be a good proof of concept and really help me get my foot in the door when it comes to getting confidence in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning&#34;&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets break down how we are going to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User must reach URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User inputs the following, username, comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User submits comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program submits comment to database after running it through some checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment board is updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a general road map there are quite a few things we can extrapolate from this. One, I can already imagine how my data will look. Two, we can create a general rest API from this point forward. Lets start with our data template&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with sqlite because Im not sure that this website will ever get enough use that I will need to migrate away from an sqlite file. Although if it ever did, im sure it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too much more complicated to migrate to a MariaDB or a full fledged Sql database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general lets get what our data structure will look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-rust&#34; data-lang=&#34;rust&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Comment {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    id: String,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ip: String,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    username: String,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    timestamp: String,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    visible: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;int32&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice there are a few things here that I have added besides the username and comment. One of them being ID. That will be our entry&amp;rsquo;s primary key. I plan on keeping the IP for governance reasons (issue bans, etc), as well as a timestamp, for historical records. The visible key, will be a simple 1 or 0. If it is 1 then it is visible. If it is 0 then it is hidden. Say I get a derogatory or inappropriate comment, I would&amp;rsquo;t want to necessarily delete it these comments should be kept to be referenced to for example for a ban appeal.I would want to especially keep them if it were to say be life threatening etc. So to prevent displaying it, I will switch the visible to 0 and contact or inform the police of said threat. This way, I still have the comment but its not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;api&#34;&gt;API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the requirements above, theres a few things we can already build out API wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/comment/new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/comment/id/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/comment/ip/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/comment/username/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building out the API this way also allows us to tailor, how and what we write when we begin to create our program. I now know that I will need quite a few get functions that return data based off of 3 unique queries. I can also identify that I only need one query to create any data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that by now you can very clearly see the benefit of planning your program out, before actually typing any code. This will help you keep from getting lost while creating your program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats about it for the theory on how this comment board will work. In the future, when i&amp;rsquo;ve got everything figured out. I may look into creating either a tutorial series on what i&amp;rsquo;ve done so far, or create youtube videos (as there are not many tutorials out on youtube for rust quite yet).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Implementing a Sick 504 Page</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/implementing-a-sick-504-page/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 12:09:39 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/implementing-a-sick-504-page/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rust takes forever to build. Im sure I could do alot better deploying the application. But who knows, maybe im doing great at deploying my [comment board](https://unorthodoxdev. net/comment) but what if there is some bug that I introduced that crashes the server 👻. What if while the server is crashed, Im at work??? Well good thing we can customize the default 504 page that nginx uses. So lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we will go to our &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt; folder and create a page called &lt;code&gt;maintenance.html&lt;/code&gt;. Inside of maintenance I have put the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Site Maintenance&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;650&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;#dc8100&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;hover&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;rsquo;ll be back soon!&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Sorry for the inconvenience but Im performing some maintenance at the moment. If you need to you can always &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;mailto:joshuawintersbrown@gmail.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;contact me&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;, otherwise I&amp;amp;rsquo;ll be back online shortly!&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;mdash; Joshua Winters-Brown&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple and sweet right? next, we have to edit our nginx default config. You can find that at &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/sites-available/default&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember! You must edit this files as sudo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside of our config file, just below your ssl certificates (or your port 80 config. Who knows maybe your rocking http naked). paste the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-config&#34; data-lang=&#34;config&#34;&gt;error_page 502 /maintenance.html;
location = /maintenance.html {
    root /var/www/html;
    internal;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, you will need to restart your nginx server. You can do so via the following command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo systemctl restart nginx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, kill your service, and run to the url to try to capture the error.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Bloging System</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/new-blogging-system/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 10:58:35 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/new-blogging-system/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/new-blogging-system/this-is-fine.png" alt="Featured image of post New Bloging System" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ive migrated my website from the ghost blogging platform to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt; (go hugo, go hugo, go!). Its a little simpler and easier to manage. I also feel as though I have more controll. Currently, im using the hugo-stacked-theme as it looks the most appealing to me, and is not a massive website with insane overhead. It also comes with a indexing feature that allows me (and you ofcourse) to search my content for specific keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about it being simple is I dont have to constantly monitor that the ghost instance isnt taking too much resources as the web server just lives on a static nginx route. The only thing I &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; have to get used to is making sure that before I push to the remote repository, that I have ran &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; so that it can build each of my pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am manually logging into the web server and pulling the repostory whenever I feel like it. In the future, ideally id set a cron job for every 30 minutes or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ehhh either way this new cms seems to be working. Keep in touch as im hoping to release a new feature to my website soon :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/read-the-damn-instructions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Read the damn instructions. Im working on a new project for the website, and Im trying to upload what I have to github (a simple readme nothing more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I create an empty repository, init, add, and commit locally. Set the remote repository, and try to push to the remote&amp;hellip; And it fails? What have I done? What did I do? I have done this probably thousands of times. Where did I mess up? Will I have to recreate the folder? Should I re init the local repo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do i do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;immediately I search the error &lt;code&gt;error, failed to push some refs to the remote github repository.&lt;/code&gt;. I find some stack overflow repository, and I begin reading. I trust stack over flow, they got some smart guys on there. Alot smarter guys on there than me because theres always awnsers to my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesnt work. It doesnt work, what did I do. I followed the advice of this internet stranger. They posted the awnser recently (2021) what have I done. This is a catosrophic faliure on my end. Ill never be able to recover from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switch tabs back to my github repository after reading the advice one strange lonlely internet post, and I read the instructions given to me by github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive forgotten to set the primary branch. Maybe ive had too much coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ghost Printers</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/ghost-printers/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 16:03:40 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/ghost-printers/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ive recently had an encounter with a printer that creates 100s of copies of its self within the computers printer settings. Ive spent quite a bit of time tinkering with this printer and its settings. I think I’ve come to a resolution. Overall, to recap what I did; Opening up the Regedit there were 100’s of keys associated with the Xerox printer. Typically, these registry keys are created when installing the printer and the windows printui.dll handles it. But the amount of registry keys meant that windows kept recreating these keys. I dug a little bit more into the registry keys and it appears that each of these keys had the following properties assigned to them. Name “PRT-AWH-321-COLOR”, Driver “Xerox …” that was pretty much it. The rest of the fields were empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off looking into removing these printers via a script etc. Doing so I found the existence of a registry key we can create that would have windows remove the printers on exit. To enable this feature you would have to create a 32bit dWord key in the following location &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print\Providers\Client Side Rendering Print Provider&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; with the name &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;RemovePrintersAtLogoff&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and the value of 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating this key, when a user logs out it should clear out any installed printers, and apply the group policy user settings next time a user logs in. Well creating that key and then logging out seemed to work. But those xerox registry keys persisted for some reason. I grabbed one of the GUIDS from a ghost printer and ran a search for all the instances I could find it in regedit. I ran across quite a few instances and ended up writing a script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by stopping the printer spooler, and then removing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HKLM:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\S&lt;/span&gt;OFTWARE&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\M&lt;/span&gt;icrosoft&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\W&lt;/span&gt;indows NT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\C&lt;/span&gt;urrentVersion&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\P&lt;/span&gt;rint&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\C&lt;/span&gt;onnections
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HKLM:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\S&lt;/span&gt;OFTWARE&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\M&lt;/span&gt;icrosoft&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\W&lt;/span&gt;indows NT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\C&lt;/span&gt;urrentVersion&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\P&lt;/span&gt;rint&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\P&lt;/span&gt;rinters

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After doing so, when you open up the control panel all the printers should be grayed out. Because these printers are being added via group policy, doing a reboot, should resolve any issues we had previously. Once the computer comes back up again, all of those printers should remain grey, and anything that gets installed via group policy should then fill in with color. But shortly after, it started happening again. I kept getting notifications of the printer installing, over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, its confirms that it is not some residual left over install, but narrows it down to one or two things. A messed up group policy or a bad driver. Looking at the group policy I could find anything wrong, so I decided to start at the driver. I took the computer off the domain, and downloaded the PCL, General, and PS, driver for the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the computers off the domain, I remove all printers. And repeat the above steps. After doing so I started with the identical driver installed, the General driver. I setup the printer and as soon as the install finishes. I immediately get the same issue again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its no longer a group policy issue, its now a driver issue. Uninstall all the printers again and start from step one. Once I get to installing the printer I use the PCL driver. I had similar issues. Finally the Post Script (PS) driver ended up working for me and resolved in no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, cleaning up the ghost printers is a pain in my ass, and is nothing but manual labor. I ended up reimaging the comptuers after fixing the driver on the print server and going from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then its seemed to have been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MECM API</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/mecm-api/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 21:02:50 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/mecm-api/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently im looking into creating an application to harvest device information using the MECM API. Since I constantly have to research where the MECM Admin service has its hooks, i thought it would be a good idea to add some general information here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basics&#34;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AdminService is a REST API that runs as a service, independent of the other web components in IIS on your site servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;service&#34;&gt;Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check the status of the service in the console under &lt;strong&gt;\Monitoring\Overview\System Status\Component Status - SMS_REST_PROVIDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;read-only-query-basics&#34;&gt;Read-Only Query Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: All queries in this section use a HTTP GET method. Also, everything is CASE SenSiTiVe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get all Devices &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;ServerName&amp;gt;/AdminService/wmi/SMS_R_System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get All Users &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;ServerName&amp;gt;/AdminService/wmi/SMS_R_User&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Device By ResourceID (same syntax for users) &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;ServerName&amp;gt;/AdminService/wmi/SMS_R_System(12345678)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get User By ResourceID &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;ServerName&amp;gt;/AdminService/wmi/SMS_R_User(12345678)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieve related class information. This example gets Operating System information for a specific device. &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;ServerName&amp;gt;/AdminService/wmi/SMS_R_System(12345678)/SMS_G_System_OPERATING_SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;https://github.com/ofgrenudo/tattoo/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattoo is the first complete program that I have written in rust. It consists of two parts, a library and the binary. One of the challenges I experienced when writing this application was the lack of abbility to include files outside of module&amp;rsquo;s folder that I was writing in. While I understand &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; why you should not do so and the kinds of compiler problems you would encounter. I think that forcing me to write a library to manage my goals was very benificial for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first library that I have had to write that actually does something. Something more than one plus one, or something simple you make when you learn C. This library was immediately applicable to my needs. It also helped me keep my programs logically seperate from eachother. The UI was allowed to get input from the UI and handle that. The backend was able to take the information from the UI and transcribe it into the database. This way of seperating the program made a dream like fusion for me when it came to keeping things clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing the library also forced me to leverage the rust documentation feature. Really cementing the whole experience together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed the experience making this application and hope to have many more safe adventures with rust :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattoo is a program designed to automatically collect device information on run, and insert it into the registry of the device. This information is intended for archival purposes and will remain there for later inspection. Some of the bennifits of storing information in the registry is that it provides a static and proctected way to maintain information like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day the computer was deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task sequence used when you deployed the computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The asset tag assigned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The device name when deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The serial number of the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The device model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The device make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to run tattoo.exe you will need at a minimum, the following file along side the executable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI, Continuous onus Integration allows for each member of a team to integrate their changes into the main branch, multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous Integration allows us to tighten the feed back loop. We are less likely to go off on your own and develop for days or weeks just to find out the approach you have taken isn&amp;rsquo;t working, or isn&amp;rsquo;t approved by peers. Continuous Integration forces you to work with your teammates earlier than when you feel is comfortable allowing for course correcting actions to be taken &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you have wasted your time. So how do we make Continuous Integration a reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tests&#34;&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests in rust are a first-class concept. This being said rust allows you to easily leverage the rust ecosystem to run unit and integration tests using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo test
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo test&lt;/code&gt; also takes care of building the project before running tests saving you a command or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-coverage&#34;&gt;Code Coverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code coverage is a easy way to see if we have overlooked any section of the code base that have been poorly tested. The easiest way to measure code coverage of a rust project is via &lt;code&gt;cargo tarpaulin&lt;/code&gt; a cargo subcommand developed by xd009642. You can install tarpaulin with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can run cargo-tarpaulin with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;linting&#34;&gt;Linting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust maintains &lt;code&gt;clippy&lt;/code&gt; the official rust linter. Clippy is included in the set of components installed by rustup if you are using the default profile. You can run clippy with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo clippy
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this CI pipeline we would like to fail the linter check if clippy emits any warnings. To do so we can run the following command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo clippy -- -D warnings
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note, from time to time clippy might suggest something you do not belive to be correct or desirable. You can mute these warnings with the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-rust&#34; data-lang=&#34;rust&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#[allow(clippy::lint_name)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;formatting&#34;&gt;Formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let machines deal with formatting while reviewers focus on architecture, testing thoroughness, reliability, and observability. Automated formatting removes a distraction from the complex equation of the PR review process. You might dislike this or that formatting choice but the complete erasure of formatting bikeshedding is worth the minor discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust actually has a built in formatter called &lt;code&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; should be included in the default rustup components but if you are missing it you can install it via&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rustup component add rustfmt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To format your whole project you can run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo fmt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the CI pipeline we will ad a formatting step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo fmt -- --check
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will ultimately fail when a commit contains unformatted code, printing the difference to the console. You can tune a project with a configuration file &lt;code&gt;rustfmt.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;security-vulnerabilities&#34;&gt;Security Vulnerabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caro makes it very easy to leverage existing crates in the ecosystem to solve at hand. On the flip side, each of those crates might hide an exploitable vulnerability that could compromise the security posture of your software. The Rust Secure Code group maintains an &lt;em&gt;Advisory Database&lt;/em&gt; on reported vulnerabilities for crates published on crates.io. You can leverage this advisory database with a tool called cargo-audit. You can install it with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo install cargo-audit
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use it you can run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cargo audit
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;github-actions&#34;&gt;Github Actions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some github actions you can add to your CI routines. To use them you will want too create the github actions folder and drop each of these files inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkdir -p .github/workflows
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd .github/workflows
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;audit.yml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;Security audit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;0 0 * * *&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;**/Cargo.toml&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;**/Cargo.lock&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;actions/checkout@v3&lt;/span&gt;

        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/ublock-origin-and-more/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ublockorigin.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt;. The browser extension that blocks ads right? Well most ads. Theres often ads from social medias sites like facebook and twitter that slip through really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I recently learned that uBlock has the capability to extend those block lists. The easiset way to add capabilities to your uBlock is to find these pre made lists of URLs and it should begin to block those ads for you. These are really the same lists that DNS filters like pi-hole use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good website that has some of these lists are &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://easylist.to&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://easylist.to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browse to the website, and find what ever list you want and then select the button &lt;strong&gt;add it to your blocker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will open a new tab, and then uBlock will prompt you to subscribe it it. Select &amp;lsquo;Subscribe&amp;rsquo; and then you will be live with that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-a-digital-garden-1&#34;&gt;What is a Digital Garden?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital garden to me is a place for for my ideas, projects, and thoughts to be planted in, and sprout and grow in the future. Besides a personal journal on my computer Ive decided to make it a publicly facing blog. Ive decided to so for a few reasons. A digital garden allows space for critiques from others. I don&amp;rsquo;t know everything, nor do I know the best way to do one thing. Posting things publicly allows for a criticism from netizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I grow, my notes will grow. They will mature from that seed to a full grown plant later in the future.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://notes.joschua.io/50&amp;#43;Slipbox/Digital&amp;#43;garden&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;(Digital Garden, Joschua)&lt;/a&gt; This is a practice of Working in Public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-in-public&#34;&gt;Working In Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://s18798.pcdn.co/motivationlab/wp-content/uploads/sites/6235/2023/02/two-routes-to-the-sr-oof-mot-and-goals.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Studies show that statistically, people are more likely to do stuff if they keep their intentions in private.&lt;/a&gt; But at times though that statement can seem counter intuitive. Often, people share their weight loss publicly on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. Many report that doing so is a great way to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, some of the reason, people post things online is because it provides a way for you to receive praise along the way. A quote that sticks with me is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Become a documentarian of what you do&amp;rdquo; - Austin Kleon, Author of Show Your Work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a documentarian means that you will develop very quickly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Metacognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Feedback Loops on Content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased Creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By documenting your self, you are working your Metacognition. You are working on thinking of your thoughts. Should I have done that? Should I have done this instead. Why did I take that route? Was it because of an experience I had? Working your metacognition and &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about your thinking allows for you to quickly determine fallacies in your thought pattern. It also helps you explain in better depth, what you are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in public also forces you to document not only your thoughts, but also your steps taken to get there. Doing this its self can help you identify un necessary steps and find better work flows.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setting a Hostname on Linux</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/setting-a-hostname-on-linux/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 20:58:46 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/setting-a-hostname-on-linux/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Danger
You will need administrative access to the device in question. Changing a hostname can have unintended catastrophic consequences if done without proper consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hostname is a computers human readable address that allows you to communicate with it, regardless of weather or not you know what its IP address is. Hostnames are pratcial and easy to remember. For whatever reason if you need to reset your hostname on a linux machine, you can follow the below instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view your current hostname type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ hostname
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I do so on the current machine, I see that for whatever reason the machines name is set to localhost. This is a problem as localhost also happens to be an alias to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;temporarily&#34;&gt;Temporarily&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To temporarily reset the hostname of the machine I should do the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ hostname changeme
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again though, unfortunately this only keeps the hostname that way until the next reboot. This might be good for testing or even just to get a prod server off of a bearing load and replace it with a backup server. But for a more permanent and serious effect, we should do the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;permanently&#34;&gt;Permanently&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ hostnamectl set-hostname imstuck
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command should set the hostname immediately as well as it should stick beyond a reboot. To confirm that the name has been configured permanently we can check the following file &lt;code&gt;/etc/hostname&lt;/code&gt; and confirm the contents are what we are expecting. The thing I would do in this case is to reboot as soon as possible so that permanent hostname can really take affect and your DNS servers can update accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Administration Tips and Tricks</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/linux-administration-tips-and-tricks/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 20:58:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/linux-administration-tips-and-tricks/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These notes should work on given any GNU / Linux based operating system. Although, should you run into any road blocks future me. Im sorry for lying to you :(.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;service-monitoring&#34;&gt;Service Monitoring&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services are a integral part of every operating system. How can I monitor and troubleshoot system services when things go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-services&#34;&gt;System Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command in a very cute way, will display all of the services installed on your server, and then display them accordingly with + or - signs to indicate weather or not it is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;service --status-all
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using grep, you can highlight services that are running (+) or stopped (-) for easy identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;service --status-all | grep &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;[ + ]&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grep can also help you identify a specific service given you know the name like &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-processs&#34;&gt;Running Process&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS displays information about a selection of the active processes. It is an alternative to TOP that only prints once. By default &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; selects all processes with the same user id (EUID). It will show you the Process ID (PID) and the terminal associated with the process (TTY), the cumulated cpu time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss and the executable name (CMD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below command will display all processes initiated by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ps
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to see a specific users processes you can do the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ps -U root -u root u
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to view every process on the system, you can do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ps -e
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-related-services&#34;&gt;Network Related Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below command will allow you to view all current connections and listening services on a system along with the processes and PIDs for each connection. It requires that you have the &lt;code&gt;net-tools&lt;/code&gt; package installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;netstat -tulpn
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say I wanted to look at what process was running on port 22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;netstat -tulpn | grep &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;22&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command will return an output of any port that has 22 in it. For me currently, I have two services listening on port 22. One for IPv4 and IPv6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example Output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ netsatat -tulpn | grep &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;22&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcp    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; 0.0.0.0:22    0.0.0.0:*    LISTEN    -
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcp6   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; :::22         :::*         LISTEN    -
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where am i on the subnet? The below tools will help you troubleshoot where your are on the subnet, what might be missing, and or misconfigured. To get a quick overview of all of your connected network cards, you can run the following command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;networkctl status
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will print out the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State: Routable or Not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address (IPv4 and IPv6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gateway Address including the associated port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NTP Servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Card Configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything above looks good we can move on to looking more closely at our network cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-my-ip&#34;&gt;Whats my ip?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ip command allows you to show address information, manipulate routing, and display network devices, interfaces, and tunnels. It is a simple concept and hard tool to learn. There really five (5) modes to ip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tunnel (Tunnel over IP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route (Routing table entry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule (rule in routing policy database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VRF (Manage virtual routing and forwarding devices)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XFRM (Manage IPSec policies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the IP addresses assigned to your server, use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ip address show
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will give you each interface, numbered from 1 to ♾️ including the status (UP or DOWN), IPv4 and IPv6 address, and subnet mask and broadcast address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![[ip-address-show.png]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To force a static IP address on a interface, you can do the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ip address add 10.66.10.9/16 dev eth0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you will want to reboot the network card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ip link set eth0 down
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ip link set eth0 up
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure for the above command you are physically connected to the server otherwise, you may lose connection if your actively using eth0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things are still looking good, we can move on too routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ip route
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will show all of routes advertised by our DHCP server as available as well as their weighted value identified by the metric lable. You should have a few things listed here. If not I would investigate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-connection-is-getting-dropped-or-reset-somewhere-along-the-wire&#34;&gt;My connection is getting dropped, or reset somewhere along the wire.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTR (Matts Trace-route) is a program that allows you to diagnose issues like these. To use MTR, you will want to do the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mtr google.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite flag to use with this is &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; it shows the dns name as well as the IP side by side allowing for a quick analysis of the network having issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mtr -b google.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also send a predetermined amount of pings with the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; flag. Otherwise known as &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; it allows you to select how many packets to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mtr -c &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; -b google.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final command you will need to know about with mtr is &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; or record. This allows you to output the information into a txt file for later usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mtr -r -c &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; google.com &amp;gt; mtr-google.log
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that doing so will lock your terminal working on dumping that data so I would recommend a smaller count. If you really wanted to get something running and then do something else in the mean time, you could apply a ampersand (&amp;amp;) to the end of your command to have it run in the background. It will spit out a PID that you can search for later to see if its complete with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps -e | grep 15225
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;monitoring-network-traffic&#34;&gt;Monitoring network traffic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, everything looks good, but data is still coming back corrupted? Lets look at the raw packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below command allows us to capture all traffic that comes or goes from this interface within the following ip and subnet range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump -i eth0 net 10.66.0.0/16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also filter based on source (&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;) or destination (&lt;code&gt;dst&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump -i eth src net 10.1.0.0/24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump -i eth dst net 10.1.0.0/24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we can also capture traffic only coming or going from a specific port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump -i eth0 port &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the port traffic with a specific host&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.66.10.123 and port &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Yellow Onion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stewed Tomatoes (Can be home made or from a can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tostadas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sour cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken breasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large pot, begin to boil your chicken. Once your chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the water and allow time for it to cool. Once cool, begin to shread the chicken by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the pot of chicken is boiling you could begin to add your tomatoes and chipotle peppers in (if raw and not from a can) to begin boiling, or add it to its own pot and boil that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the chicken is shredded, begin to chop your onion. You want long pieces of onion so avoid dicing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add oil to a pan and begin to pan fry your onions, while they are getting tender pour out your tomatoes and adobo pepers and chipotle sauce into a blender and mix until everything is done. It does not hurt to add some chicken broth or vegitble broth in this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add your chicken into the pot of onions and mix, slowly add the tinga sauce we made in the previous step to the pot and combine. The chicken should be swimming in the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow the chicken to marinate and the sauce to thinken up and lose some whater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are ready begin to serve the tinga on tostadas, with pickeled onions, raddish, lettuce, beans, sour cream, or whatever else floats your boat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Custom Start Menu Layouts</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/custom-start-menu-layouts/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows 11 and Start Menus &lt;em&gt;suck.&lt;/em&gt; Nothing works the way Microsoft says it should unless you use Intune. So to get around it, we just copy the bin. For now I&amp;rsquo;m doing both, considering sometime in the future Microsoft might get its stuff together and allow the JSON file to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/custom-start-menu-layouts/start-menu-layouts.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-new-layout&#34;&gt;Creating a new Layout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a build PC configure your new layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run the &lt;code&gt;Export-StartLayout&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;StartLayout&lt;/code&gt; file and change the &lt;code&gt;pinnedList&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;primaryOEMPins&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the JSON file to &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsof\Windows\Shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, windows holds an encrypted version of the startup file in the &lt;code&gt;%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState&lt;/code&gt; folder. Copying the &lt;code&gt;start.bin&lt;/code&gt; file to whatever computers same folder, will essentially do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also created a mini program that you can use to quickly do the above commands to quickly reproduce the steps above. I will put the latest version of the source blow, alternatively you can check my Github repository out here &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ofgrenudo/confs/tree/main/scripts/start-layouts&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Migrating Ghost Blog Domain Names</title>
        <link>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/migrating-ghost-blog-domain-names/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 12:20:21 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://unorthodoxdev.net/post/migrating-ghost-blog-domain-names/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note! I have migrated away from ghost blog and now manage my site on hugo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason when I was looking up how to change [[domain names]] for my ghost blog, I kept running into recommendations that stated I should just reinstall ghost. I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that especially since so much content exists on this server already. It also reminded me that I probably need to take regular backups of the server anyways. Or at least, double book blog posts somewhere just in case! (Truthfully most posts end up in my notebook to begin with, and end up polished on the website). Below are my steps to migrate my blogs DNS record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set your new DNS record, a day in advanced to the IP address of your server. In my case I was migrating from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.unorthodoxdev.net&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.unorthodoxdev.net&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://unorthodoxdev.net&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://unorthodoxdev.net&lt;/a&gt;. I created a ANAME record and allowed it to propagate overnight. In the morning, I did the below steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghost config url {new_url}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghost setup ssl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghost restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally you want to visit your website and check your cert and go from there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to throw in that you might want to remove your ANAME record for whatever your website was before and upgrade it to a CNAME record. CNAME records are really just a redirect to whatever ANAME record you provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
